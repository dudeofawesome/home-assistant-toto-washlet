# TOTO Washlet IR Capture Findings

These findings came from a live ESPHome IR receiver capture against the Washlet
remote. Codes are written as:

```text
rc_code_1 / rc_code_2 / command
```

## Confirmed Controls

| Control                | Captured code sequence                      | Notes                                                   |

## User Profiles

The remote has four user profiles, but selecting later profiles requires stepping
through earlier profiles. These captures should be treated as sequences rather
than independent single commands.

| Profile action | Captured code sequence                                                       | Notes                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| User profile 1 | `0x0 / 0x0 / 0xD5`, then `0x2 / 0x8 / 0x95`, then `0xD / 0x0 / 0x55`         | Confirmed in a full 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 cycle. |
| User profile 2 | `0x4 / 0x0 / 0xD5`, then `0x4 / 0xC / 0x95`, then `0xD / 0x0 / 0x55`         | Confirmed in two full cycles.              |
| User profile 3 | `0xC / 0x0 / 0xD5`, then `0x2 / 0xC / 0x95`, then `0x1 / 0x0 / 0x55`         | Confirmed in two full cycles.              |
| User profile 4 | `0x2 / 0x0 / 0xD5`, then `0x2 / 0xC / 0x95`, then `0x1 / 0x0 / 0x55`         | Confirmed in two full cycles.              |

## Stateful Controls

These controls appear to encode the resulting state or level in `rc_code_1` or
`rc_code_2`. The captures below should not be modeled as simple increase/decrease
buttons without more mapping.

| Control                 | Captured values                                                                                                        | Notes                                                                                         |

| Water temperature sweep | `0x8 / 0x9 / 0xEC`, `0x0 / 0x9 / 0xEC`, `0xA / 0x9 / 0xEC`, `0x1 / 0x9 / 0xEC`, `0x9 / 0x9 / 0xEC`, `0xD / 0x9 / 0xEC` | User stepped through all levels and ended on `3/5`; exact level mapping still needs labeling. |
| Dryer air temperature   | `0x2 / 0x0 / 0x1C`                                                                                                     | User identified this as level `4/5`.                                                          |

## Buttons With No IR Decode

These buttons produced no `remote.toto` decode during the capture attempts:

- Power
- Settings

## Follow-Up Capture Targets

- Map all water temperature levels to their exact `rc_code_1` values.
- Map all dryer air temperature levels.
- Map all seat temperature levels.
